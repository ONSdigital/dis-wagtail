# Scheduling

Wagtail publishes pages using a management command. When run, this command publishes any pages which are due to be published.
It is expected to be run using an external scheduler (e.g. cron).

On the ONS infrastructure, we use the Kubernetes CronJob.

In other environments, such as the local one, we use [`APScheduler`](https://pypi.org/project/APScheduler/) to run a [continuous scheduler task](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dis-wagtail/blob/main/cms/core/management/commands/scheduler.py)
that triggers the [`publish_bundles`](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dis-wagtail/blob/main/cms/bundles/management/commands/publish_bundles.py) management command
every minute, and [`publish_scheduled_without_bundles`](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dis-wagtail/blob/main/cms/bundles/management/commands/publish_scheduled_without_bundles.py) every 5.

## `publish_bundles`

Is a management command that publishes [bundles](bundles.md) that are scheduled and ready to publish.

## `publish_scheduled_without_bundles`

Is a modified version of the Wagtail core [`publish_scheduled`](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/blob/main/wagtail/management/commands/publish_scheduled.py)
management command that excludes any pages that are in an active bundle.
